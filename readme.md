# ALFAT
Assembly Language Flowchart and Analysis Tool, developed by students at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.

## Overview
This tool's main use is for the analysis of assembly and assembly-like languages. Languages can be specified by creating a `.json` file describing the operators of the language. See the `CodeSyntax/LC3.json` file for example. 

## Installation
To build the current version, first download the repository. After opening it in your IDE of choice, build `EngineTester` as a .jar file. If all dependencies are installed, this should build a stand-alone version of the program.
